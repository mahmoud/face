What sets Face apart from other CLI libraries?
----------------------------------------------

argument parsers. Software isn't a competition, but there are many

  line up before the Command will build to start up.
* Streamlined, Pythonic API.
* Handy testing tools
* TODO: contrast with argparse, optparse, click, etc.
