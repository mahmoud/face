--loop-count 5  # a comment here
# and a comment there
--verbose

#### Notes:

# one flag and value per line at most
# blank lines and comment lines are also allowed

# --flag "quoted values # with hashes work, too" note that comments
# can be directly adjacent to flags like:
#    "--verbose#set verbose mode to true"
# but this is due to a bug in Python's shlex module.

# flagfiles can include other flagfiles, and even have cycles
# cycles are no issue because flagfiles are stateless
